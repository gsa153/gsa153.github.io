## The Three game pillars


#### WHAT:

Hidden roles in a chaotic social setting.

The game centers around identity concealment, quick thinking, and order-matching in a
fast-paced coffee shop environment, combining light memory with deduction.

#### HOW:

Tension through imperfect information and limited communication.

Players must track customers, guess order matches from partial context, bluff or deduce intent,
and use scarce challenge resources carefully, all while interacting under time or social pressure.

#### WHY:

To create suspenseful, high-stakes fun where trust is fragile and every action has weight.

The game aims to generate emotional spikes through surprise reveals, false accusations, and
satisfying detection, encouraging replayability and dynamic group interaction.


## Thematic Backstory

It’s a seemingly ordinary day at a charming cafe tucked into a busy New York City street. The air
smells of freshly ground beans, customers buzz in and out, and the team behind the counter is
hard at work. Greeting regulars, crafting complicated drink orders, and keeping the energy high.

Among the cafe staff are a few standout personalities:

**Tessa**, a 21 year old college student majoring in Psychology and Statistics who loves all things
creative! Art, cooking, baking, photography, and more. She is truly multi-talented and loves
getting to know others. An excellent small-talker, she lights up everyone’s day and has excellent
customer service.

**Marco**, a former nightlife bartender who traded late-night cocktails for early morning
cappuccinos. He is calm under pressure, rarely cracks a smile, but secretly crafts the best
mochas and lattes. He’s the type who speaks with few words but always remembers your usual.

**Ms. Kowalski**, an early retiree, used to teach high school chemistry. While she had initially
picked up a barista gig at the local cafe “just for fun”, she decided this was her passion after
teaching and switched entirely. Her chemistry expertise aided her precise drink-making skills.
Espresso shots are measured like titrations and her witty remarks are bound to make you at
least a little scared but impressed.

**Emraan**, a personal trainer by day, picked up a part-time barista job to pay for sports nutrition
courses. He’s high-energy, competitive, and secretly loves experimenting with vegan baked
goods on slow shifts. He might lecture you about your protein and caffeine intake, but most
people ignore him and instead focus on his unfortunate jokes.

Each barista brings something special to the team: a sharp memory, a quick wit, or simply a
warm smile. Together, they’ve built a rhythm that keeps the chaos flowing smoothly. But beneath
the laughter and routine, something darker stirs.

But one barista has bigger ambitions.

They’ve been showing up early, staying late, and quietly plotting to rise above the rest. With
hopes of taking over the cafe and proving their worth, they’re no longer satisfied with teamwork.
Instead, they’ve turned to sabotage; slipping fake orders into the mix, sowing confusion, and
risking the cafe’s reputation to serve their own goals.

As customers grow frustrated and mistakes pile up, the team begins to suspect that something’s
off. Someone isn’t just making honest errors, someone is trying to tear things apart from the
inside!

Will the others catch on in time? Or will the saboteur succeed in brewing betrayal behind the
bar?

## Game Inspirations

If you have ever been to a coffee shop during peak hours, you have probably seen how
stressful it can be for the baristas. So many people are coming in and out of the shop
during this time, and it can be hard to keep track of everyone; even as a customer
observing. As a barista, it can be tough to balance all of the orders coming in while also
having to take even more at the same time! On top of that, you have to make sure each
one is made correctly, because customers can get pretty cranky when their drink is
wrong. Some of the orders are complicated, and some of the names can sound really
similar, but baristas somehow make it all look easy. In Barista Betrayal, we wanted to
recreate that hectic environment; with a twist of sabotage. While the game didn’t take
direct inspiration from any specific board games, it shares a lot in common with a board
game called Mafia. Both games rely on secrecy, as no one knows each other’s roles
(except for the order taker), and both involve deceit as well as potential strategic bluffs,
especially from the “bad” player trying to stay hidden. The difference is that Barista
Betrayal adds a memory element, where the strategy isn’t just about pointing fingers,
but about sneaking in sabotaged orders without getting caught. It also uses fewer roles,
keeping a narrower focus and encouraging more fast-paced gameplay
