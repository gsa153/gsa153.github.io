### ☕ Rulebook

Welcome to the high-stakes world of Barista Betrayal, a hidden-role party game where teamwork meets treachery in a chaotic coffee shop.

##### 🎭 Roles

There are three distinct roles in the game:
Order Taker (1 player)

An honest player who acts as the dealer and manages the flow of the game. The Order Taker:

* Draws cards from the Order Deck and announces them.
* Can choose when to pause taking new orders (with limits).
* Tracks the number of matches and manages the Challenge Tokens.

##### Honest Baristas (3+ players)

Loyal baristas who try to fulfill drink orders truthfully. They:

* Match customer names with drink orders.
* Work together to identify suspicious behavior.
* Can call for challenges when sabotage is suspected.

##### Dishonest Barista (1 player)

A hidden saboteur among the baristas. Their mission:

* Secretly insert fake matches into the game.
* Remain undetected while pushing the café toward chaos.

##### 🏆 How to Win

Honest Team Wins If:

* They correctly identify the Dishonest Barista (max 2 guesses), OR
* There are 8 or more honest matches and fewer than 4 dishonest matches on the board when the game ends.

Dishonest Barista Wins If:

* They successfully place 4 or more fake matches, OR
* The honest team uses both challenge guesses and both are wrong.

##### 🎲 Setup

 * One player volunteers as the Order Taker.
 * The Order Taker:
     * Shuffles a number of Customer role cards equal to the number of baristas minus one.
     * Adds one Sabotage card to the mix.
 * Each barista receives one face-down role card.
 * Players check their role privately and keep it face-down for the rest of the game.

##### 🔁 How the Game Works

The game proceeds in clockwise turns, starting with the Order Taker.
Order Taker’s Turn

* Draw and announce a new order: e.g., “Latte for Jake.”
* Pass the order (and any leftover unmatched ones) to the next barista.

The Order Taker may instead skip taking new orders (only after 6 unmatched orders exist).

* ⚠ You can’t skip two turns in a row.
* ⚠ Skipping removes a random match (honest or dishonest) from the board.

If there are no matches on the board, the Order Taker must draw.
Barista’s Turn

    Draw a Customer card.

    If it matches a current order (e.g., “Cappuccino for Molly”), you may:

        Announce the match and place the pair face-down in a match slot.

    If no match exists:

        Return the card to the bottom of the deck.

        Pass all unmatched orders to the next player.

The Dishonest Barista may lie and claim a fake match to secretly place a sabotaged pair.

##### ❗ Challenge Mechanic

Players may challenge a suspicious match using one of two total Challenge Tokens.

    If the challenge is correct, the honest team wins immediately.

    If the team makes two incorrect challenges, the Dishonest Barista wins.

##### ⚖ Trade-Offs & Dilemmas
##### 🔍 Challenge Timing vs. Certainty

    Dilemma: Use a Challenge Token early or wait?

    Trade-off: Acting fast might catch the saboteur — but risks wasting your guess.

🛑 Order Taker: Take Orders or Stop?

    Dilemma: Should you keep taking orders or pause?

    Trade-off: More orders = more honest matches and more cover for sabotage.

😈 Dishonest Barista: Play Safe or Sabotage?

    Dilemma: Blend in or risk exposure?

    Trade-off: A fake match is risky — but could be the win condition.

🗣 Baristas: Speak Up or Stay Silent?

    Dilemma: Should you raise suspicion about a match?

    Trade-off: Sharing doubts can help — or backfire if you’re wrong.

🧠 Match Memory vs. Card Management

    Dilemma: Can players keep track of all customer–drink pairs?

    Trade-off: The more chaos, the harder it is to spot lies — even for honest players.

🎭 Using Honest Matches for Cover

    Dilemma (for the Dishonest Barista): Make a real match before lying?

    Trade-off: Builds credibility but pushes the honest team closer to a win.

    Pro Tip: Trust no one — even your favorite coworker might be the one slipping in the sabotage.
