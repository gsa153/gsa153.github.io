## Trade Offs and Dilemmas

#### Challenge Timing vs. Certainty

- **Dilemma**: When should the team use one of only two Challenge Tokens?
- **Trade-off**: Early challenges might catch the saboteur quickly, but risk wasting a token on
a guess. Waiting too long increases the number of hidden matches, but holding the
token longer might be beneficial since players can gather information about the
saboteur.

#### Order Taker: Take Orders or Stop?

- **Dilemma**: Should the Order Taker continue taking new orders or pause to reduce
confusion?
- **Trade-off**: More orders mean more chances to create honest matches, but also more
cover for the Dishonest Barista to sneak in a fake one. Stopping slows the game and
risks removing a good match at random.

#### Dishonest Barista: Play Safe or Sabotage?

- **Dilemma**: Should they pretend to be helpful or make bold dishonest moves?
- **Trade-off**: Playing safe keeps suspicion low, but wastes turn. A risky fake match could
secure a win, or provoke a challenge and end the game.

#### Baristas: Speak Up or Stay Silent?

- **Dilemma**: Should a barista question a suspicious match openly?
- **Trade-off**: Voicing doubts could help gather consensus for a challenge, or make you look
suspicious if you’re wrong. Staying quiet avoids drawing attention but allows sabotage to
go unchallenged.

#### Match Memory vs. Card Management

- **Dilemma**: How well can players track all announced orders and potential matches in their
minds?
- **Trade-off**: Paying close attention for dishonest behaviors can make the team closer to
identifying the saboteur. But if too many cards circulate, even honest players may make
mistakes that look suspicious, this can lead to them being falsely challenged.

#### Dishonest Barista: Using Honest Matches for Cover

- **Dilemma**: Should I make a real match before lying?
- **Trade-off**: Doing so builds credibility, but it also advances the honest team’s win
condition. Delay too long and you may not place 4 fake matches in time

## Average Playtime

- **Playtime avg**: 20min
- **Duration of each turn**: roughly 20s each, order taker naturally has longer times as they are announcing the orders

Also, we tested with the Order Taker being randomly selected (with the role cards) and they reveal their role card as Order Taker.
