title: Trade-Offs & Dilemmas
---

**🔍 Challenge Timing vs. Certainty**

Dilemma: Use a Challenge Token early or wait?
Trade-off: Acting fast might catch the saboteur — but risks wasting your guess.

**🛑 Order Taker: Take Orders or Stop?**

* Dilemma: Should you keep taking orders or pause?
* Trade-off: More orders = more honest matches and more cover for sabotage.

**😈 Dishonest Barista: Play Safe or Sabotage?**

* Dilemma: Blend in or risk exposure?
* Trade-off: A fake match is risky — but could be the win condition.

**🗣 Baristas: Speak Up or Stay Silent?**

* Dilemma: Should you raise suspicion about a match?
* Trade-off: Sharing doubts can help — or backfire if you’re wrong.

**🧠 Match Memory vs. Card Management**

* Dilemma: Can players keep track of all customer–drink pairs?
* Trade-off: The more chaos, the harder it is to spot lies — even for honest players.

**🎭 Using Honest Matches for Cover**

* Dilemma (for the Dishonest Barista): Make a real match before lying?
* Trade-off: Builds credibility but pushes the honest team closer to a win.
* Pro Tip: Trust no one — even your favorite coworker might be the one slipping in the sabotage.
