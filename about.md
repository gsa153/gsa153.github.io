### Thematic Backstory

It’s a seemingly ordinary day at a charming café tucked into a busy New York City street. The air smells of freshly ground beans, customers buzz in and out, and the team behind the counter is hard at work — greeting regulars, crafting complicated drink orders, and keeping the energy high.

Each barista brings something special to the team: a sharp memory, a quick wit, or simply a warm smile. Together, they’ve built a rhythm that keeps the chaos flowing smoothly. But beneath the laughter and routine, something darker stirs.

One barista has bigger ambitions.

They’ve been showing up early, staying late, and quietly plotting to rise above the rest. With hopes of taking over the café and proving their worth, they’re no longer satisfied with teamwork. Instead, they’ve turned to sabotage — slipping fake orders into the mix, sowing confusion, and risking the café’s reputation to serve their own goals.

As customers grow frustrated and mistakes pile up, the team begins to suspect that something’s off. Someone isn’t just making honest errors — someone is trying to tear things apart from the inside.

Will the others catch on in time? Or will the saboteur succeed in brewing betrayal behind the bar?
