This section outlines the roles, objectives, and gameplay structure for Barista Betrayal. Read through carefully to understand how to set up the game, take turns, and uncover (or conceal) the truth behind each coffee order.

##### 🎭 Roles

There are three distinct roles in the game:
Order Taker (1 player)

An honest player who acts as the dealer and manages the flow of the game. The Order Taker:

* Draws cards from the Order Deck and announces them.
* Can choose when to pause taking new orders (with limits).
* Tracks the number of matches and manages the Challenge Tokens.

##### Honest Baristas (3+ players)

Loyal baristas who try to fulfill drink orders truthfully. They:

* Match customer names with drink orders.
* Work together to identify suspicious behavior.
* Can call for challenges when sabotage is suspected.

##### Dishonest Barista (1 player)

A hidden saboteur among the baristas. Their mission:

* Secretly insert fake matches into the game.
* Remain undetected while pushing the café toward chaos.

##### 🎲 Setup

 * One player volunteers as the Order Taker.
 * The Order Taker:
     * Shuffles a number of Customer role cards equal to the number of baristas minus one.
     * Adds one Sabotage card to the mix.
 * Each barista receives one face-down role card.
 * Players check their role privately and keep it face-down for the rest of the game.

##### 🏆 How to Win

Honest Team Wins If:

* They correctly identify the Dishonest Barista (max 2 guesses), OR
* There are 8 or more honest matches and fewer than 4 dishonest matches on the board when the game ends.

Dishonest Barista Wins If:

* They successfully place 4 or more fake matches, OR
* The honest team uses both challenge guesses and both are wrong.


##### 🔁 How the Game Works

The game proceeds in clockwise turns, starting with the Order Taker.

**Order Taker’s Turn**

* Draw and announce a new order: e.g., “Latte for Jake.”
* Pass the order (and any leftover unmatched ones) to the next barista.

The Order Taker may instead skip taking new orders (only after 6 unmatched orders exist).

* ⚠ You can’t skip two turns in a row.
* ⚠ Skipping removes a random match (honest or dishonest) from the board.

If there are no matches on the board, the Order Taker must draw.

**Barista’s Turn**

* Draw a Customer card.
* If it matches a current order (e.g., “Cappuccino for Molly”), you may:
* Announce the match and place the pair face-down in a match slot.
* If no match exists:
    * Return the card to the bottom of the deck.
    * Pass all unmatched orders to the next player.

The Dishonest Barista may lie and claim a fake match to secretly place a sabotaged pair.

##### ❗ Challenge Mechanic

Players may challenge a suspicious match using one of two total Challenge Tokens.

* If the challenge is correct, the honest team wins immediately.
* If the team makes two incorrect challenges, the Dishonest Barista wins.
