title: Introducing Barista Betrayal
---

A Social Deduction Game of Trust, Deceit, and Lattes

Welcome to the morning rush — where steam hisses, customers line up, and every order matters. Barista Betrayal throws you behind the counter of a bustling city café, where not all is as it seems. Among your team of hardworking baristas, one has gone rogue — slipping in sabotaged orders in a secret bid to take over the café.

This fast-paced social deduction game blends light memory, bluffing, and deduction mechanics in a charming coffee shop setting. Inspired by classics like Mafia and The Resistance, Barista Betrayal keeps things focused and dynamic — no long lists of roles, just pure tension and tight turns.
🕵️ Hidden Roles. Honest Intentions. Hectic Orders.

Each game, players take on secret roles — some working hard to match customer names to drink orders, while one Dishonest Barista sneaks in fake matches. Only two Challenge Tokens stand between justice and chaos. Will you catch the saboteur in time?
